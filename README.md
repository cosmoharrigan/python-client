OpenCog Python Client
=====================

Defines an interface to allow OpenCog experiments to be written as short Python scripts.

#### Functionality

- Start and stop the OpenCog server
- Control an OpenCog server on your local machine or on a Vagrant box
- Control the steps of each mind agent
- Capture the contents of the attentional focus at each step in Scheme format
- Capture the discrete dynamical evolution of the attentional focus
- Capture the discrete dynamical evolution of the STI of each atom in the attentional focus
- Store the captured data as a timeseries in a CSV file for plotting and analysis (using pandas, matplotlib, SciPy, etc.)
- Render the captured data as a sequence of graphical visualizations of the attentional focus

#### Requirements

- Requires the REST API to be configured as described [here](http://wiki.opencog.org/w/REST_API#Configuration) and installation of the [requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/install/#install)

- For full functionality, you should also install [PyMongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/installation.html), [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/) and [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/Download..php)

#### Example usage

##### IPython Notebook example
The recommended way to learn how to use **python-client** is with IPython Notebook. An example demonstration is provided that combines documentation, interactive code execution, and graphical visualizations.

**The example can be viewed online [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/opencog/python-client/blob/ipython-notebook/example.ipynb).** Note that the online version is not interactive, whereas on your own machine it will be interactive.

To run the example on your machine, you will need to install [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) first.

Then, run ```ipython notebook``` from the command line in this folder, and then open the notebook named ```example.ipynb```

##### Additional examples
See the usage example in ```example.py```

Also see an example visualization of the attentional focus dynamics as a slideshow of PNG images rendered from DOT representations in ```graphics.py```

#### Vagrant (optional)

**Note: These instructions are optional and only apply if you are planning to use Vagrant.**

The Client API can be used with Vagrant. For example, you can run the OpenCog daemon inside a virtual machine, and then do all of your Python development in Mac OS.

To set up OpenCog in this manner, follow these instructions:
http://wiki.opencog.org/w/Building_OpenCog_in_a_Linux_Virtual_Machine_on_Mac_OS_X

Then, install the Python package [python-vagrant](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-vagrant)

Then, to use the Client API with Vagrant, open the file ```configuration.py``` and set the parameter ```USE_VAGRANT``` to ```True``` and ```VAGRANT_ID``` to the ID of your VM

#### OpenCog Python Client API Documentation

The client API has docstrings for each method that describe correct usage. A summary of the available methods is presented below.

##### Server

**Before performing operations with OpenCog, you need to have an instance of a Server object:**

```
import opencog
server = opencog.Server()
server.start()
```

###### start()
    Bootstraps the OpenCog CogServer daemon so that it will run in the background with the
    REST API so that further commands can be issued by sending them to the REST API

###### stop()
    Terminate the OpenCog CogServer daemon

##### Operations

**After you have started a Server, you can perform the following operations.**

###### create_point(timestep, atoms, scheme=None)

    with the ECAN attention allocation discrete dynamical system

    Each point in time contains:

    - a list of "atoms" which consists of a list of objects of type Atom
      (Refer to the definition of the Atom object)

    - (optional) A Scheme representation of the point in time
